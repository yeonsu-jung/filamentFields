This .txt file is a list of x,y,z coordinates of 11 filaments in 32^3 volume.

Each filaments's coordinates are seprated by their label.

Eg: the rows that comes after label1 are the x,y,z coordinates of the 1st filament
and similarly rows after label2 are the x,y,z coordinates of the 2nd filament

This list of filaments has to be the "filament_nodes_list" in filamentFieldsTest.cpp or "filaments" in test.py

Each filaments are of different length
